<img src="../imgs/splash.png" alt="German Shepherd splashing in a puddle.">

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Your new family members will always be there for you, and some will even go as far as giving up their own life to protect yours. Always, always show your love and appreciation for your amazingly furry friends.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Brushes, doggy shampoo, dog shoes, etc.</li>
<li>As many doy toys as you can find/buy</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Set aside several hours (12 should suffice)</li>
<li>Brush each dog daily to keep up with the shedding (jk nothing stops the shedding so enjoy being covered in fur for the rest of your life!)</li>
<li>Rotate rigorous activities daily such as: hiking, running, playing fetch, and swimming</li>

<p>As you get to know your new family, you'll know what they individually need, but keeping them mentally stimulated is just as important as physical exercise!</p>
