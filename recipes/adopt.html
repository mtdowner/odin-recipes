<h1>'Who Rescued Who', Am I Right?</h1>

<img src="" alt="">

<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Let's face it: you're lonely, not that fun to be around, and quite frankly not the best or worst person in the world. Well, luckily there's a solution that even benefits a most precious and innocent breed of dog: the German Shepherd. That's right, baby! We're on a mission to rescue these magnificant souls from the evil bars they live behind.</p>
  <p>Now, let's get ready to break our soon-to-be friends out of doggy prison!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <p>Before we become a doggy-fugitive camp, we must attain some key items such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A big heart</li>
<li>An even bigger yard</li>
<li>Lots of patience</li>
<li>Pen and paper</li>
<li>Internet connection</li>
<li>A lint roller, or two...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

  <p>In order to bust out our friends, research and planning is essential!</p>
<ol>
<li>online and search all of the rescues/shelters in your area for German Shepherds.</li>
<li>Make a list of each one you find.</li>
<li>Sort your list starting from oldest to youngest</li>
<li>Call each location to set up appointments to visit your new friends</li>
<li>Go to each appointment and start taking them home, making sure all the seniors are seen first (young pups get adopted much easier and quicker)</li>
<li>Check out your new fleet of loyal, loving soldiers</li>
<li>Pat yourself on the back for saving so many lives!</li>
</ol>
