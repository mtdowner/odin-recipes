# **The Odin Project - Odin Recipes**

This is the first project for TOP. I have some knowledge of web development, so this project didn't come with too many hurdles. I did, however, struggle with planning the actual content and what I wanted to choose as my recipe. I struggle with choosing one thing to stick with often, but I ultimately just went ahead and wrote what was on my mind and stopped overanalyzing everything.

I also need to work on relative/absolute paths. I typically keep all of my files in the root folder which is a bad habit because future projects will need to be organized appropriately.
